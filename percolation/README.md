### Usage

###### Type
`python graphs.py <matrix_size1> <matrix_size2> ... <experiments_number> <attempts_number>`

This will produce all the missing files with tables in the same directory and a single graph containing P_cond(p) for specified matrix sizes with given experiments and attempts numbers.
The text files are included so you don't have to recalculate everything over again, just plot the result.

###### Example
`python graphs.py 5 10 15 20 100 10000`
